from pyDatalog import pyDatalog

# In this assignment you will do some simple knowledge representation
# and reasoning within datalog within Python. The domain you will be
# working within will be academic degree program requirements checking.

# 1.
# TODO: complete the definition of the load_course_catalog function.
# This function should assert facts for which courses teach which
# subjects. You *MUST* use the predicate name 'subject' with the
# first argument being the literal name of the class and the second
# being the literal name of the subject for the tests to pass.
#
# assert the following information:
# 1. cs101 is a stem class
# 2. mat167 is a stem class
# 3. art310 is a humanities class
# 4. eng101 is a humanities class
# 5. his110 is a social science class
# 6. psy150 is a social science class
def load_course_catalog():
    """asserts all knowledge of classes and their subjects"""
    pass

# 2.
# TODO: implement assert_student_completed_class. It is up to you
# how you represent this knowledge in datalog. Student id's will be
# literals. 
def assert_student_completed_class(studentid, courseid):
    """asserts that the specified student has completed the specified course"""
    pass

# 3.
# TODO: implement load_graduation_rules. This function should simply
# make one call to pyDatalog.load. This call should contain all needed
# clauses (only 1 is necessary) to ensure any student that has met the
# graduation requirements will be considered a graduate (in queries).
# The graduation requirements are simply that a student has taken at
# least one course from each of the available subjects. It is up to
# you how to implement these clauses.
def load_graduation_rules():
    """loads rules for determining if a student has graduated"""
    pass

# 4.
# TODO: return the results of a call to pyDatalog.ask. Form a
# query that determines if the student graduated or not. 
def ask_if_graduated(studentid):
    """determines if the given student has graduated or not"""
    pass

# 5. complete the definition of find_graduates below.

    res = set()
    ans = None
    #TODO: put your datalog query in the string on the next line to find all graduates
    #ans = pyDatalog.ask("REPLACE-ME")

    # s001 graduated and s002 did not.
